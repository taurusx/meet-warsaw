## General Description

Done as a part of [Android Basics Udacity's course][udacity-course]

This app consists of 4 lists of attractions in various categories (Buildings and Places, Monuments and Parks, Food and Drink, Sport and Leisure). Although attractions' descriptions and images are hardcoded in the app, the lists are populated dynamically via custom `ArrayAdapter` which uses custom object to store data concerning each location. 

## Main Goals

**Main Goals** of the task:
1. Create custom object with getters methods, which will store information about one location to visit
2. Create custom `ArrayAdapter` which will use custom object to populate Views
3. Populating `ListView` with given data using custom single item layout
4. Using the `Intent`s to move between screens
